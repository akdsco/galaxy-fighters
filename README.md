A JavaScript board game

* * *

### Request

Create a two-player, turns based game using JavaScript. The board will have blocked locations which can't be jumped over 
by players. There will be different weapons for players to pick up when moving across the board. If players pass on adjacent 
fields, fight mode begins. Players can attack and defend with their weapons.

### Solution

I designed the object-oriented application and utilised JavaScript and `jQuery` framework. I deployed `Gulp` and `Babel` to 
help in development processes and to make my code available to all browsers, even though I was using the new ES6 
JavaScript syntax.
